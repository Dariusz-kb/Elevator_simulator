# Elevator_simulator using python

A simple elevator simulator takes a user entry of number of floors and a number of costumers.
    The building is being created based on user input, and costumers list which holds information
    about each of the costumers like its Id, its starting floor and its destination floor which are randomly picked.
     Elevator starts at ground floor moving up and picking up costumers and letting them out on their destination
      floors. Once the costumer have used a elevator its removed from a costumer list. When Lift reaches a top floor
      a direction is being changed and elevator moves down floor by floor.The simulation ends when all the costumers
      use an elevator.
